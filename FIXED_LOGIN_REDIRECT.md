# Fixed Login Redirect

This document explains the fix for the login redirect issue in the application.

## Overview

We've fixed the login redirect issue by ensuring that the login page redirects to the main dashboard after successful login, and the root page checks for authentication and redirects accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Login Page Redirect

We've updated the login page to redirect to the main dashboard after successful login:

```jsx
// In app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
// Redirect to dashboard after successful login
router.push("/main")
```

This ensures that after successful login, users are directed to the main dashboard.

### 2. Updated Root Page

We've updated the root page to check for authentication and redirect accordingly:

```jsx
// In app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if user is authenticated
    const hasAuthToken = document.cookie.includes('auth_token=')

    if (hasAuthToken) {
      // If authenticated, redirect to main dashboard
      router.push('/main')
    } else {
      // If not authenticated, redirect to login
      router.push('/login')
    }
  }, [])

  // Return a loading state while redirecting
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <p className="text-lg">Redirection en cours...</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This ensures that the root page checks for authentication and redirects to the appropriate page.

### 3. Authentication Flow

The updated authentication flow is:

1. **Initial Access**: Root path (`/`) checks for authentication and redirects accordingly
2. **Not Authenticated**: User is redirected to the login page
3. **Login**: User enters credentials and submits the form
4. **After Login**: User is redirected to the main dashboard
5. **Authenticated**: User can access the main dashboard and other pages

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Proper Authentication Flow**: The application now has a proper authentication flow
2. **No Redirect Loop**: There's no longer a redirect loop between the root page and the login page
3. **Consistent UI**: The login page still displays without the sidebar and header
4. **Clean Implementation**: The implementation is clean and follows best practices

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses:

1. **Next.js App Router**: For page routing and layouts
2. **Route Groups**: For organizing pages with different layouts
3. **Client-Side Authentication**: For checking authentication status and redirecting accordingly
